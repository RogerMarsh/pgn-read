9. Qe2 {%02 [ 9.Nc3 is the major alternative in this variation of the QID.
Model games are Keres - Taimanov, U.S.S.R. Champ.,1951, and Keres - Smyslov,
Zurich,1953. ]} 9... Nc6 10. Nbd2 cxd4 11. exd4 Nb4 {%02 [ Black's treatment
diverges at this point. Spassky played 11...a5 12.a3 Rc8 13.Rfe1 Bd6 14.Ne5
Ne7 15.Ndf3 h6 16.Nd2 ( why? ) Bb8 17.Nf1 a4! against Langeweg at Beverwijk,
1967. Filip - Portisch, Moscow,1959, continued 11...Rc8 12.Rac1 Rc7? 13.a3! dc
14.bc Re8 15.Rfd1 Bd6? 16.Ne4! Nxe4 17.Qxe4 g6 18.Qe3 Bf8 19.Be4 with a great
advantage for White ( d5 is imminent ). Portisch improved his play in his game
against Najdorf at Santa Monica,1966: 11...Re8 12.Rad1 Bf8 13.Bb1? Rc8 14.Ne5
dc 15.Nxc6 Bxc6 16.bc g6 17.Bd3 Bg7 18.Nf3 Nd7! 19.Rfe1! Bb7 with an edge for
Black. The main line, according to the Russian analyst Voronkov, is 11...Re8
12.Rac1 Rc8 13.Rfd1 Bf8 14.Nf1! ( Najdorf - Unzicker, Varna,1962, went 14.Bb1
g6 15.Nf1 dc? 16.bc Bg7 17.Ng3 Qc7 18.Bc3! Ne7? 19.d5! with a winning
advantage for White ) g6! 15.Ne3! Nb4 ( 15...Nh5 16.g3 Nf6 is better ) 16.Bb1
Bg7 17.Ne5 Rc7 18.c5! with advantage for White, Hort - Langeweg, Beverwijk,
1967 ). The text move is an idea of Alekhine's ( consultation game vs.
Tartakower, Paris,1932 ) except Black was not castled and White's Q unmoved. ]}
12. Bb1 Rc8 13. a3 {%02 [ Loftsson suggested 13.Ne5, but his move is not bad
if followed up correctly. ]} 13... Nc6 14. Bd3 Re8 15. Rac1 {[ Preparing c5. ]}
15... Bf8 16. Rfe1 dxc4 {%02 [ Correct timing, because White threatened to
play 17.c5 with his last move as the resource, ...e5, is prevented. ]} 17. bxc4
g6 18. Qe3 {%02 [ ? I think White begins to lose the thread of the position
hereabouts. 'better is' 18.Nf1 Bg7 19.Ng3. ]} 18... Bg7 19. h3 Qe7 {%02 [ The b
est idea of the game. Black takes care to prevent the critical advance d5,
strengthens the dark-colored squares around his K, observes the a3 P, and
prepares to mount a direct attack on the hanging Ps. White offered a draw with
his next move. ]} 20. Rc2 Qf8 21. Nf1 Red8 22. Rd1 Ba6 23. Qe2 {%02 [ White's
time trouble panic begins. There may be a better move, but what is it? ]} 23...

trouble. Consistent is 29...Qa4 30.R1c1 Nb3 31.Nxb3 ( if 31. cxd5 Nxc1 32.Rxc8
Rxc8, Black wins the exchange for only temporary discomfort ) Bxc1 32.Nxc1
Bxc4 33.Bxc4 Rxc4 34.Rxc4 Qxc4, and Black has winning chances based on: 1)
control of the light-colored squares, 2) the weak B, and 3) a possible passed
P on the b-file. ]} 30. d5 Nf5 {%02 [ The best chance, Black gives up a piece
to defend the long diagonal. The next 12 moves were made as fast as we could
move the pieces and punch the clock. ]} 31. g4 exd5 32. Qxe8+ {+} 32... Rxe8

retreat left the P unprotected. The position may still be equal without this
blunder. ]} 36... Bxc4 37. Bf6 Bxf1 38. Rxc8 Rxc8 39. Kxf1 Rc1 40. Rxc1 Bxc1

no written score. 41...Na5 wins easily. ]} 42. Bxc5 bxc5 43. a4 Kg7 {
