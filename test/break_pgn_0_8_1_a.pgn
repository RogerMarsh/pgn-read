1. e4 Nf6 2. e5 Nd5 3. d4 d6 4. f4 {%02 [ An unusual move, which should lead
to nothing unusual as White can transpose back into the main line of the Four
Pawns Attack. ]} 4... dxe5 5. fxe5 Nc6 {%02 [ 5...Bf5 6.c4 Nb6 7.Nc3 e6
transposes to the innovative continuation of Victor Korchnoi against Ewfim
Geller, U.S.S.R. Champ., 1960. The development of Black's Queen Knight is
deferred. ]} 6. Nf3 {
[ ?! An old mistake. Correct is 6.c4 Nb6 7.Be3 avoiding the pin. ]} 6... Bg4 7.
Be2 e6 8. O-O Qd7 9. c3 {%02 [ A solid move. If 9.c4?! Nb6 10.Be3 0-0-0, with
more than sufficient counterplay against the center Pawns. ]} 9... O-O-O 10. b4
{[ ? Too ambitious, 'better is' 10.Qe1. If 10.Ng5 Bf5, followed by ...f6. ]}
10... f6 11. exf6 gxf6 12. a4 h5 13. a5 Bh6 {%02 [ ?! 13...Bd6 is more
effective, as 14.b5 N6e7 15.c4 Nf4 16.c5 fails: 16...Nxe2+ 17.Qxe2 Bxf3 18.
Qxf3 Bxc5, etc. ]} 14. b5 {%02 [ ?! Stronger is 14.Bxh6 Rxh6 15.Qd2 Rh7 16.b5.
Now 16...Nb8 is forced, because if 16...N6e7? 17.c4 Bxf3 18.Bxf3 Nb4 19.Rd1 (
19.Qxb4? Qxd4+ wins ) c5 20.dc and White has a P ( John Collins in Chess Life,
January, 1961 ). ]} 14... Nce7 15. Qb3 {%02 [ ?! White is consistent, but he
gets a losing position. If, instead, 15.Bxh6 Rxh6 16.Qd2 Nf5, and Black has a
fine game. ]} 15... Bxc1 16. Rxc1 Nf4 17. Re1 Ned5 18. Nbd2 Rhg8 19. c4 {
[ ? 19.Bf1 is cracked by 19...Qg7, again threatening 20...Nxg2. The text move
weakens d4, giving Black more than enough basis for a combination.]} 19... Nxg2
{%02 [ ! A decisive stroke. ]} 20. Kxg2 Bxf3+ {%02 + [ ?! The White K will be
caught in the center. However, the quickest win is 20...Bh3+ 21.Kh1 ( forced )
Bg2+ 22.Kg1 Bxf3+, one tempo ahead of the game varia-tion. ]} 21. Kxf3 e5 {
[ ! Striking at the weak d4 square. If now 22.cxd5 Qh3+, and Black wins. ]} 22.
Kf2 Nf4 23. d5 Rg2+ {+} 24. Ke3 Qh3+ {+} 25. Bf3 {
[ If 25.Ke4 f5+, and Black wins. If 25.Nf3 e4, and Black wins. ]} 25... Ne6 {
%02 [ ! Consistently exploiting the weak dark-colored squares. ]} 26. dxe6 {
[ ? Allows a forced mate, but what can White do? Sutherland had only one
minute on his clock to my two minutes. Black threatens to win material with ...
f5. If 1) 26.Qc3 Nd4 27.Rf1 Re2+ 28.Kd3 f5 is very strong. If 2) 26.b6! Nd4!
is only a variant of the first line as 27.ba Nxb3 28.a8Q+ Kd7 29.Qxb7 Nxd2,
and Black wins easily. White must play 27.Qc3 cb 28.ab a6 29.Rf1 Re2+ 30.Kd3
f5, with a similar dilemma.]} 26... Qxh2 {
White resigns. [ If 27.Bxg2 Qf4+ 28.Ke2 Rxd2#. Diabolic! ]} 0-1
