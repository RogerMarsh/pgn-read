The pgn package verifies that game scores in PGN format represent legal games.


Notes:

A likely source of game scores is a *.pgn file containing many games.

Both the strict export format and many less strict import formats are supported when parsing game scores.  In particular a format with all non-significant whitespace removed is supported for database storage (not PGN archive storage).  Whitespace includes move numbers and periods between moves but excludes anything within a comment.

Game scores are verified to see that they represent legal games.

The package does not support the generation of PGN export format.  Yet.
