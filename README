===================================
Portable Game Notation (PGN) parser
===================================

.. contents::


Description
===========

This package provides a parser for chess game scores in PGN format.

Both the strict export format and many less strict import formats are supported.

Classes for handling a single game and files of games are provided.

These classes verify that a game score represents a legal game.


Installation Instructions
=========================

Build dependencies

* `Python`_ 3.3 or later 

Install the package by typing

   python setup.py install

at the command prompt with setup.py in the current directory.

You may need to give the path and version of Python depending on your system's configuration:

   <path to python>/python<version> setup.py install

   For example

      C:\\Python33\\python setup.py install

         on Microsoft Windows or

      python3.3 setup.py install

         on Unix-like systems.


Notes
=====

The lookup tables really need to be implemented more efficiently.  But other areas of chess game processing still offer better opportunities for speeding things up in my use of the package.
